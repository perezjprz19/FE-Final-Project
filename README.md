# Final-Project

<h2>Technologies:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Github Repositories</li>
  <li>Figma</li> 
</ul>


 <h2>Design Concept</h2>
<p>I completed a single page website for Andre, a fictitious musician. I used a combination of flexbox and grid to build a responsive single page website. 
The desktop site starts with a fixed navigation above the header, which makes it easy for desktop users to access any content within the page at any time. This navigation collapses into a hamburger menu for mobile screens using Jquery. There is an immediate call to action in the header that allows users to open several streaming sites on a separate tab; ideally, this would be directly linked to the Andre’s profile on those sites.</p>

  <p>Andre’s need to remain connected to social media and within reach of possible talent scouts inspired the fixed sidebar navigation design, which includes many of the music platforms a musician might use to promote their music and remains within view on the right side of the screen for both, desktop, and mobile screens.</p>
  
<p>The page displays a viewport height header image of Andre in the recording studio, followed by his three albums displayed in a two-column grid layout. I used a smaller version of the header image for smaller screens to ensure that Andre is always fully visible. The grid used to display the albums lets the page respond to the user’s screen size as it collapses into a single column when the window size decreases, which makes it easy for his fans and possible talent scouts to access the website on the go.</p>
  
<p>I used flexbox to display a bootstrap table for the tour schedule. I also used Bootstrap for the “Buy Tickets” buttons. The “Come Hangout with Me” prompt above the tour schedule makes Andre come across as a friendly and open personality. I used grid to display some images of the concerts Andre has played in. The layout changes to flexbox for mobile sites. All images are fully accessible in the mobile version, even if not always fully visible.</p>

<p>Finally, the “About” section includes another picture of Andre, a short blurb, and another call to action, “Let’s Talk.” The call to action is animated when the page first loads, but only on the very first click of the “About” link in the main navigation as to not overwhelm the user. When the CTA is clicked, a contact form drops down.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  The biggest issue I faced was with positioning elements, resizing images, and toggling the active states of the navigation bar for mobile and desktop.
  
  <h2>Upcoming Improvements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refactor the code for the hamburger menu</li>
    <li>Link a database to the tour table</li>
    <li>Add an easily accessible "back to top" button for the mobile view</li>
   </ul>
